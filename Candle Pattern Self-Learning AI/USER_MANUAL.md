   - Confluence score (higher = stronger signal)
   - Risk/Reward ratio

**Understanding Signals:**
- **BUY**: Bullish signal, consider long position
- **SELL**: Bearish signal, consider short position
- **WAIT**: Moderate signal, wait for better entry
- **IGNORE**: Low confidence, skip this opportunity

**Confluence Score:**
- **75%+**: High probability, strong confluence
- **50-75%**: Moderate, wait for confirmation
- **<50%**: Low confidence, avoid

### 2. Training Page

**Purpose**: Train ML model on historical candlestick patterns

**Steps:**
1. Select symbol (e.g., EURUSD, GBPUSD)
2. Choose timeframe (H1 recommended)
3. Set number of bars (5000+ for better results)
4. Click "Start Training"
5. Monitor progress in message box

**Tips:**
- More data = better predictions
- Train on timeframe you'll trade
- Retrain weekly with new data
- Different symbols may need separate models

**What Happens During Training:**
- System analyzes thousands of candle patterns
- Identifies recurring patterns
- Learns which patterns predict price movements
- Calculates confidence scores

### 3. Backtest Page

**Purpose**: Test strategy performance on historical data

**How to Run Backtest:**
1. Configure parameters:
   - Symbol: Currency pair to test
   - Timeframe: Trading timeframe
   - Number of Bars: Historical data amount
2. Click "Run Backtest"
3. Wait for results (30 seconds - 2 minutes)

**Understanding Results:**

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Total Trades**: Number of trades executed
- **Win Rate**: % of profitable trades (aim for >50%)
- **Profit Factor**: Gross profit / Gross loss (>1.5 is good)
- **Total Return**: Overall profit/loss percentage

- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return (>1 is good)

**Equity Curve:**
- Shows account balance over time
- Upward trend = profitable strategy
- Smooth curve = consistent performance
- Sharp drops = high risk periods

**What Makes a Good Backtest:**

## Understanding the Technology

### Smart Money Concepts (SMC)

**Order Blocks (OB)**
- Last opposing candle before impulse move
- Institutional entry zones
- High probability reversal areas
- System tracks unmitigated blocks

**Fair Value Gaps (FVG)**
- Price imbalances on chart
- Areas where no trading occurred
- Often act as support/resistance
- Price tends to fill these gaps

**Break of Structure (BOS)**
- Breaking previous swing high/low
- Confirms trend continuation
- Strong momentum signal

**Change of Character (CHOCH)**
- Failure to make new high/low
- Potential trend reversal
- Warning signal

**Liquidity Sweeps**
- Price briefly breaks level then reverses
- "Stop hunt" by institutions
- Strong reversal signal

### Multi-Timeframe Analysis

**H4 (4-Hour)**
- Determines overall bias
- Trend direction
- Major structure

**H1 (1-Hour)**
- Confirms H4 bias
- Entry zone identification
- Structure validation

**M15 (15-Minute)**
- Precise entry timing
- Risk management levels
- Quick confirmation

**How It Works:**
1. H4 shows bullish bias
2. H1 confirms bullish structure
3. M15 provides exact entry point
4. All timeframes must align for best signals

### Pattern Recognition

**What the AI Learns:**
- Candlestick formations
- Pattern sequences
- Price action context
- Successful vs failed patterns

**Prediction Process:**
1. Current pattern extracted
2. Matched to learned patterns
3. Historical outcomes analyzed
4. Probability calculated
5. Confidence score assigned

## Risk Management

### Position Sizing

**Automatic Calculation:**
- Based on account balance
- Fixed % risk per trade (default 1%)
- Adjusts for stop loss distance
- Respects maximum position size

**Example:**
- Account: $10,000
- Risk: 1% = $100
- Stop Loss: 50 pips
- Position Size: Calculated to risk exactly $100

### Risk Limits

**Per Trade:**
- Maximum 1-2% account risk
- Minimum R:R ratio 2:1
- ATR-based stops

**Portfolio:**
- Maximum 3 concurrent trades
- Total exposure < 5%
- Correlation monitoring

**Daily:**
- Maximum 3% daily loss
- Auto-stop on limit breach
- Reset each trading day

### Best Practices

1. **Never risk more than 1% per trade**
2. **Always use stop losses**
3. **Maintain 2:1 minimum R:R**
4. **Limit concurrent positions**
5. **Keep trading journal**
6. **Review performance weekly**
7. **Adjust strategy based on results**
